# Milvus


To insert a PDF document dataset into a Milvus Vector Database, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1. Convert PDF documents to text: Extract the text content from the PDF documents. You can use libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfminer to parse and extract text from PDF files.

2. Preprocess the text: Clean and preprocess the extracted text data as per your requirements. This may involve removing unwanted characters, normalizing the text, and handling any specific formatting issues.

3. Tokenize the text: Tokenize the preprocessed text into smaller units such as words or subwords. This step is essential to prepare the text for embedding or vectorization.

4. Generate embeddings or vectors: Use an appropriate language model or embedding technique to generate embeddings or vectors for the tokenized text. Popular choices include word embeddings like Word2Vec or sentence embeddings like Universal Sentence Encoder. You can use libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Gensim for this step.

5. Connect to the Milvus server: Establish a connection to the Milvus server using the Milvus Python client library.

6. Create a collection: Create a collection in the Milvus server to store the vectors. Specify the desired dimensionality for the vectors based on the chosen embedding technique.

7. Insert vectors into the collection: Insert the generated vectors into the collection using the  `insert()`  method provided by the Milvus client library.
